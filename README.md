# Universal-TV
This was a project for a previous instructors at my college that was to help him develop a TV application for users to view on their phones. You could surf the current selection of shows that were playing at the time or look for specific shows a well.
## It uses react native as the main language
It took some time to build, and the old API is no longer available, although the paths just have to be updated with a new TV API and it will work showing you the current selection of shows.
